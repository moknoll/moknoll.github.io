## Projects üìÇ

Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on:

### Born2beroot
**Description:** A system administration project focused on setting up and configuring a virtual machine. The goal is to learn the basics of operating systems, particularly Linux (Debian/CentOS), and implement security measures such as UFW and SSH. <br>
**Skills:** Bash scripting, system configuration, user permissions management.

### ft_printf
**Description:** A custom implementation of the C printf function. This project involves handling various format specifiers (%d, %s, %x, etc.) and implementing dynamic memory allocation and formatting logic. <br>
**Skills:** String manipulation, variadic functions, algorithm design

### get_next_line
**Description:** A C function designed to read and return lines from a file one at a time. The project emphasizes efficient memory management and working with file descriptors. <br>
**Skills:** Buffer management, file handling, memory optimization 

### libft
**Description:** Description: Development of a personal C library containing commonly used functions such as ft_strlen, ft_split, ft_strjoin, and more. The goal is to build a strong understanding of fundamental data operations and reusable code. <br>
**Skills:** Pointer handling, data structures, modular programming. <br
